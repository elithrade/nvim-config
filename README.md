# nvim-config

This repo contains my Neovim configurations using `lua`. The ultimate goal is to transform my current Neovim configurations from [coc-nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and bunch of other plugins to using `telescope`. `treesitter` etc..

My current Neovim configurations located in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/elithrade/dotfiles) repo.

`inital.lua` was originally copied from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), I made a few modifications to fit my needs.

## Installation

### Windows

Copy `inital.lua` to `~/AppData/Local/nvim` folder.

### Linux

## To do

- OS specific plugin initialisation
- Modularization of plugins
- Initial bootstrapping/installation script
